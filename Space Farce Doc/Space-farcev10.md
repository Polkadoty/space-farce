**1.00 INTRODUCTION**  
  **1.1 Background**.  Space Farce depicts the conquest of space by different alien races at the strategic, operational, and tactical level.  The rules have been developed from simplistic versions of strategic and tactical systems found in other science fiction games.  The classic sci-fi game Starfire\! has been one inspiration for this smaller set of rules.    
  **1.2 Set-up**.    
  **1.3 Scenarios**.  Examples of scenarios that can be developed and played with this system are “New Worlds,” “Rebellion,” “Resurrection,” and “Alien Menace.”  
    **1.31** New Worlds.  Each player starts out with one newly space faring alien race in an unexplored galaxy.  The goal of the players is to explore and conquer the galaxy.  
    **1.32** Rebellion.  Each player starts out with a system on the edge of a large but stratified galactic empire.  The goal of the players is to fight off the old empire and become the new center of a new galactic empire.  
    **1.33** Resurrection.  Each player starts out with a system that survived the death throes of a now defunct empire.  The goal of the players is to rebuild society and establish a new empire.  
    **1.34** Alien Menace.  Each player represents a system as in the Rebellion or Resurrection scenarios, but a new alien race empire enters the galaxy bent on seizing it all.  The players must stop the alien beings and establish their own control over the galaxy.  
  **1.4 Rules**.  These rules are a work in progress.  Players are encouraged to contact the author for any suggestions @ jamesd\_iii@yahoo.com.  
  **1.5 Other Materials Needed**.  File folders for each space system, 10-sided dice, pen and paper. A healthy dose of computer skills is highly recommended to help automate and record information.  
  **1.6 Explanation of Terms**.  
    **1.601** Star Systems.  Points in space consisting of single or binary stars and their associated planets, asteroids, and warp points.  Each location is an area within the star system, and warp points connect star systems to each other.  
    **1.602** Area.  A location in a star system that contains a planet, asteroid, warp point, or other item of interest.  Travel is conducted between areas within star systems.  
    **1.603** Inhabited Area.  A location consisting of a planet, moon, asteroid, etc., that is inhabited, i.e. possesses Economy Points.  For convenience, Planet (see below) is often used to refer to areas that contain planets, moons, and asteroids, both uninhabited and habited.  Inhabited areas can be present on all planets, moons, and asteroids, but to varying degrees based on the type.  Habitable worlds are the only areas that naturally grow (increase economy points).  
    **1.604** Warp Point.  A point where a ship can travel instantly from one star system to another.  Each warp point connects one star system to another star system.  Warp points are also areas within star systems.  Warp points are open (visible) or closed (invisible).  Although warp points can be transited in both directions, one end is visible and can be detected through system surveys, while the other is invisible and can only be detected by the observation of ships transiting through them.  Visible WPs are said to originate in a system, invisible warp points end in a system.    
    **1.605** Planet.  A space body orbiting a star or binary star system.  Planets may be rocky, gaseous, icy, or asteroids.  Each planet is a separate area within a star system.  An asteroid belt may consist of up to 5 different areas.  
    **1.606** Economy Points.  Represent population, industry and taxes; used to build ships/bases/PCF, spend on Research and Development, pay for maintenance, trade, and transfer.  
    **1.607** Build Points/Repair Points. 1=1 Economic Point; build/repair systems on ships/bases.  
    **1.608** Maintenance Points. 10=1 Economic point, supply ships/bases/PCF monthly.  
    **1.609** Ships. Space vessels which move from area to area and can transit warp points.  
    **1.610** Bases. Space vessels which do not move.  Also ground bases on planets (which also do not move).  
    **1.611** Small Craft. Space vessels which launch from bases and ships and move areas, but are unable to transit WPs.  
    **1.612** PCF. Planetary Control Force:  an element of soldiers equipped for combat in space and on planets.  
    **1.613** Fleets/Task Forces/Groups/Flotillas. A number of ships (one or more) acting together for movement, combat, and supply.  
    **1.614** Crew.  The personnel who operate a ship or base.  
    **1.615** Captain/Admiral.  The commander of a ship or base.  
    **1.616** Empires. A system or group of systems under the control of a central government (player).

**2.00 GAME SET-UP**  
  **2.01 Create the Galaxy.**  Decide on a number of star systems the galaxy will consist of.  Use the system creation rules to create each star system.  
  **2.02 Determine the Scenario.**  Determine which scenario to play.  Assign home systems based on the scenario.    
  **2.03 Assign players and referee**.  Assign the home systems to each player.  Designate a referee to track all information.  
  **2.04 Set up initial system and empire information**.  Create the empire for the rebellion and resurrection scenarios.

**3.00 SYSTEM CREATION**  
  **3.1 Galaxy Creation.**  The umpire/referee is encouraged to generate the entire galaxy prior to the start of the game, although this is not necessary for the New Worlds scenario.  Decide on the number of star systems the galaxy will consist of, and generate each system according to the rules below.  As an alternative, the umpire/referee can create each system on his own.  
  **3.2 Star System Generation.**  For each system, generate the system type, star type, warp points, planet numbers and types, and maximum EP.  Record the information on a system data chart.  An example is provided. 

| Roll | System Type |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1-7 | Single Star |
| 8-9 | Binary Star |
| 0 | Starless Nexus |

    **3.21** System Type.  Determine the type of the system.  Roll a d10.  The system will consist of a single star, binary star, or a starless nexus.  If the system is a single or double star, complete all the remaining sections.  If the system is a nexus, only complete the system warp point section.

| Roll | Star Type |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1-2 | Red |
| 3-4 | Orange |
| 5-6 | Yellow |
| 7-8 | White |
| 9-0 | Blue |

    **3.22** Star Type.  For each star in the system, roll a die to determine its type.  Any system planets will be determined based on the star type.  Binary systems will determine planets twice, once for each star.

| Roll | Warp Points |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 2-4 | 1 |
| 5-6 | 2 |
| 7-8 | 3 |
| 9-10 | 4 |
| 11 | 5 |
| 12 | 6 |

    **3.23** System Warp Points.  Roll a die to determine the number of open warp points present in the star system.  Modify the die roll based on the system and star type:  
**Number of System Warp Points**  
	Modifiers (Cumulative)  
		\-1		Orange/Red Star  
		\+1		Blue Star  
		\+1		Binary Stars  
		\+2		Starless Nexus  
After rolling for number of warp points roll a d100 for each warp point to determine the destination system of each warp point (or a dX based on the size x of your galaxy).  

| *Type* | *0* | *4* | *5* | *6* | *7* | *8* | *9* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Red | 1-4 | 5-6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 | X |
| Orange | 1-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8 | 9 | 0 | X |
| Yellow | 1-2 | 3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |
| White | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |
| Blue | 1-3 | X | 4-5 | 6 | 7 | 8-9 | 0 |

    **3.24** Number and Type of Planets.  For each star, roll a d10 to determine the number of planets around that star.  A result of “0” on the chart (not a die roll of zero) means that star has no planets.  Consult the Star Type tables based on the number of planets you have rolled to determine the type of planets in the system.  Example:  Star System 01 is a Blue star system.  The referee rolls a “9” on the number of planets table, and sees there will be eight planets in the system.  Consulting the Blue Star table, he sees that there will be 3x R planets, 1x rH planet, 3x G planets, and one I planet.  Adjusting Planet Types:      
      **3.241** rH planets--are habitable on a roll of 1-5.  If habitable, record the planet as H.  If not habitable, treat as R.     
      **3.242** G planets--gravity may destroy inner planets.  Start with outermost G plan and work in.  Roll a die.  1 or 2 means next planet becomes asteroids.  Roll for each G planet.  
      **3.243** Binary Stars--roll for number of planets for each star.  Divide number at each star by 4 and round.  This is the number of planets present for each star.  If any planets are present, automatically add one belt of asteroids after the last planet.

| Planet Type | Economic Points |
| :---- | :---- |
| H | 40 |
| R | 10 |
| G | 4x(number moons) |
| I | 4 |
| Asteroids | 2 per group (max 10\) |

    **3.25** Planet EP.  For each planet, determine the maximum possible EP.  Consult the *Max EP on Planets/Moons/Asteroids Table*.  For G planets, roll the number of exploitable moons around each G planet to determine the maximum EP for the G planet.  For   
Asteroid each asteroid belt, up to 5 separate areas may be colonized to a maximum of 2 EP each.  Note that only H planet population grows (increases EP) through natural means.    

| Roll | Moons |

  **3.3 Player System Selection and Empire Creation.**  Depending on the scenario, each player receives a home world.    
    **3.31** Determine Racial Outlook (RO).  Roll a d10.  The result is the player race’s racial outlook.  In general, a higher number means a greater militancy and xenophobia toward other races.  A player’s (or Non-Player Race’s) RO will affect its attempts at inter-empire relations and willingness to surrender.  
    **3.32** Create Empire Infrastructure.  Each player receives 2x his EP to create the empire’s infrastructure.  This includes any bases, ships, or PCF.  Players are highly advised to build a base station in their home area with sufficient shipyard (Sy) capacity.  
    **3.33** Locate Initial Forces.  The player may place his forces anywhere within the home system for the start of the game.  
  **3.4 Non-Player Race (NPR) System Selection and Empire Creation.**  Depending on the scenario, the referee may be required to construct NPR empires.  Use the same method for NPRs as for creating player empires.  
    **3.41** NPR Type.  If not generating a specific empire for a scenario, an NPR may still be created during galaxy creation.  Any star system with a habitable planet may contain a civilization.  Roll on the civilization table to determine what type.  

| Die Roll | Civilization |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1-4 | No Significant Civilization |
| 5-6 | Pre-Industrial (EP \= 1\) |
| 7-8 | Industrial Civilization (EP \= 5\) |
| 9-10 | High Tech Civilization (EP \= 10\) |

    **3.42**  NPR System Creation.  Determine the NPRs RO, create the infrastructure, and locate initial forces per the player system creation.  Note that pre-industrial civilizations may only construct PCFs.  Industrial Civilizations may construct PCF, Ground Bases, and Space Bases with the following systems:  A, O, /\\, C, E.  The E represents pre-high tech power sources.

**4.00 TURN SEQUENCE**

    f) Receive New Units/Repaired Units/Survey Information  
    g) Upgrade Experience  
  **4.2 Monthly Turn Sequence Explanation.**  
      **4.21** Receive Economy Point Revenue:  Players simultaneously receive EPs in the treasury equal to the total EP value of inhabited worlds in their empire, as well as any EP traded last turn.  
      **4.22** Spend Economy Points:  Players simultaneously spend accumulated EPs on maintenance, transfer, building, research, and trade, in that order.    
      **4.23** Write Orders:  Players simultaneously write orders for movement and/or attack/defense by fleets/task forces, PCFs, and bases.  (Optional:  players write orders for production for the following month.)  
      **4.24** Resolve Weekly Movement/Combat/New Orders:  All movement occurs simultaneously one week at a time. After each week of movement, any combats are resolved.  If any forces complete their orders, a player may issue new orders.  After one month of movement and combat has been resolved, move to the next phase.  
      **4.25** Roll for Economic Growth, Research, Maintenance System Loss:  Players simultaneously roll for percentage chances for economic growth and research.  Players select and mark off failed systems due to maintenance.  
       **4.26** Receive New Units/Repaired Units/Survey Information:  Players commission ships completing construction this turn.  Players complete repair of ships in shipyards.  Players receive survey information if system surveys are completed.  
      **4.27** Upgrade Experience:  All ships and PCF meeting time requirements for experience change are upgraded to their new experience level.  Units meeting combat requirements for experience change are updated immediately after battle.

**5.00 RECEIVE ECONOMY POINT REVENUE**   
  **5.1 System Economy**.  Economy Points (EP) represent the size of the population, the efficiency of industry, and the ability of the government to extract resources for use.  EP are the source of an Empire’s strength.  EP are used to build Ships/Bases/PCF, spend on research and development, pay for maintenance costs, transfer populations, and trade.  Planets and inhabited areas produce EP each month.  EP are converted into build points and maintenance points at the following ratios:  
Economy Points (EP)  
	1 EP \= 1 Build Point \= 10 Maint. Points \= Takes up 10 Cargo Spaces  
  **5.2 Receiving Economic Points**.  An empire receives EP into its treasury equal to the total EP value of all systems in the empire.  The empire also receives any trade revenues from EP traded last turn.  The player may choose to strip an economy in order to gain extra EP.  This may be done for any and/or all inhabited areas each month, with the corresponding benefits and penalties (see below).  The player may also receive EP from occupied enemy inhabited areas (see Using Captured Resource Points below).  Of an inhabited area is blockaded, then the EP are not added to the treasury, but may be spent by the player only at the individual location.  
    **5.21** Stripping an Economy.  A player may double the EP he receives for one month from a planet or inhabited area by stripping extra resources.  For each month the player doubles his EP from a location he receives a reduction in yearly growth by 5% (round up to nearest 10%); i.e. the 1st time growth \= 0%, the 3rd time growth \= \-10%, etc.  If the planet is not habitable, the first time the economy is stripped the economy growth \= \-10%.  
    **5.22** Economic Growth.  Only habitable planets can grow and gain economic points naturally.  All other areas can only increase EP through transfer.  Each habitable planet will grow up to 10% per year (unless the economy is stripped, see “**Stripping an Economy**” above).  At the start of each year, the max natural growth for the year will be one point per 10 EP or fraction thereof.  EX:  habitable planet with 15 EP will grow a max 2 points.  During the economic growth phase each month, each planet has a 10% chance per possible growth point of gaining an EP.  Example:  the above planet has a 20% chance of gaining 1 EP.  Once the total number of possible EP have been gained, no further growth is allowed that year.  If the year ends without growth of all possible EP, increase the EP of the planet by enough EP (including the EP already gained) to equal the beginning number of EP divided by ten, rounding **down**.  Example:  If the planet above gained one EP during the year, it could not gain any more EP because 25/10=1.5 rounded to 1 \= the number of EP it already gained.  
    **5.23** Economy Transfer.  Economy Points may be transferred from one planet to another.  This represents colonist leaving a planet to populate another planet.  Ten cargo spaces are required to transport each EP.  It takes two months for each transferred EP to settle and begin producing (cumulative).  This is the only way to place or increase the number of EPs on non-inhabitable planets (G, I, Ast, etc) because only habitable planets may increase EP size through natural growth.  
	During the economy growth phase, habitable planets which have transferred EP to other planets have an increased chance of recovering/growing the EP.  For each point transferred, there is a 20% chance (cumulative) per turn the economy will recover 1 point, until the base EP is regained.

1. ##     **5.24** Trade.  Players may conduct trade with other empires.  They can trade up to ¼ of the smaller player’s total EP (or less).  For each EP traded, the player receives 2 EP the following month.  The two players must trade the same amount.  The EP must be transported (1 EP \= 1 Trade Point \= 1 Cargo Point) to the other players star system to be unloaded at a base or inhabited planet.  A player must agree to at least an economic alliance in order to conduct trade.

    **5.25** Using Captured Resource Points.  When an enemy planet is taken over by friendly forces, during the following turns, the capturing player can use a number of EP equal to PCF, but no more than half the total EP of the planet.

**6.00 SPEND ECONOMY POINTS**  
  **6.1 Spending Economic Points**.  Players simultaneously spend accumulated EPs on maintenance, transfer, building, research, and trade, in that order.  
  **6.2 Maintenance**.  All ships/bases/PCF require supplies monthly to remain in operation.  For every 10 spaces/PCFs or fraction thereof, a ship/base/PCF group requires 1 maintenance point (MP).  (Optional A:  Each mine requires one MP.  Optional B:  The maintenance cost of a base/ship/PCF is equal to the number of spaces it contains.  Each EP will make 100 MP.)  Example:  3 space DD \= 1 MP, 9 space BB \= 1 MP, 15 PCF \= 2 MP, 24 space base \= 3 MP.  Ships/bases/PCF that don’t receive the required number of supplies in a month lose one system/PCF per point needed.  One EP will make 10 MP.  Each MP requires **one/tenth** cargo point to be shipped.  
    **6.21** Maintenance—Transport Requirements.  Bases not in a star system with at least one friendly inhabited planet must receive maintenance every month from transports and must have at leas 1 cargo space in the base.  Bases in a star system with at least one friendly inhabited planet must receive maintenance points every month from transports if they do not have enough cargo spaces to store a month supply of maintenance.  Otherwise, the base is assumed to be supplied by the local freighter network  (EX:  15 space base station with 0 cargo spaces in a friendly inhabited star system requires a transport, BS with 1 or more cargo spaces does not).  
	Ships in an area with an inhabited planet do not require transports to provide supply.  Ships not in an area with an inhabited planet (i.e. one containing EPs) must have sufficient transport space available in their own or transport ships to carry all maintenance.  Ships that are away from a friendly area for more than one month must bring or have transports bring enough maintenance for the entire voyage.  
    **6.22** Alliances and Maintenance.  Although players may be allied, they may not provide one another with maintenance support unless they write specific orders to do so, provide an explanation of how the two different empires maintenance requirements will be made compatible, and are approved to do so by the umpire/referee.

2. ##   **6.3 Building.**  A player may build ships, bases and PCF.  One EP makes one Build Point.  The build point cost of a ship or base is equal to its size.  Each PCF costs one build point to create.  A player may also create maintenance points.  One EP will make 10 MP.  MP are needed for fleets to move away from inhabited planets.  

    **6.31** Building from Inhabited Areas (Planets)**.**  Inhabited areas (planets, asteroids, moons, etc.) may build PCF, ground bases, space stations/bases, small craft, and ships up to DD sized (3 BP).  A player may spend no more total EP in a month on ground bases, small craft, and ships produced at that location than its EP for that habitable area.    
      **6.311** PCF.  PCFs are produced in habitable areas.  Players can never build more PCF in an inhabited area in one month than its EP for that habitable area (this is allowed in addition to any EP spent on ground bases and ships).	  
      **6.312** Ground Base.  A Ground Base represents all the defensive and offensive capability on the planet.  Therefore, there is only one “Ground Base” allowed per habitable location. Ground Bases are built in the same manner as other ships and bases.  A ground base may be built to any standard size (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.).  The player pays for the cost of the Base in advance, designates the systems that make up the base, and builds the base over time.  A ground base may consist of the following “ship” systems: A. /\\, V, C, CIC, D.  Up to 3 BP of ground base is constructed each month.  (Example:  a player decides to build a ground base consisting of AAAAVVVVC.  This costs a total of 9 EP/BP.  After 3 months, the ground base is completed.)  Unlike ships and bases, a Ground Base may be expanded later.  (Example:  several months later, the player decides to add missile defenses to his base.  He spends 3 EP/BP and adds 3xD to his base at the end of construction:  AAAAVVVVCDDD.)  The remainder of the base remains fully operational even if additional construction occurs.  Ground bases pay standard maintenance costs.  Ground bases do not require E or Sy systems.  Ground bases take power from the planet power grid, and ships produced by planets use the inherent shipbuilding capability of the planet.  
      **6.313** Space Bases.  Planets may construct space bases in their area.  Space bases are built in the same manner as ships.  A planet may only construct up to 3 BP total per month on any/all space bases.  (Example:  the player wishes to build 2 bases, each of 6 BP.  It will take 4 months for both bases to be completed).  A space base may be built to any standard size.  
      **6.314** Ships and Small Craft.  Planets may build small craft, and ships up to DD size.  A planet may spend no more than it’s EP per month on all small craft, ships, ground bases, and space bases.  A planet may build multiple small craft and ships at once as long as the total number of EP are not exceeded.  If the entire cost of the ship is paid for, it is constructed at the end of the month.  (Example:  the same month that the player expands his Ground Base with 3xDs, he decides to build some escorts and small craft.  He has 12 EP on the planet, so he can build up to 9 BP worth of ships this turn.  He chooses to build 4x ES ships and 2x bomber small craft.  All are constructed at the end of the month.)  Ships are automatically placed in orbit in the area.  Small craft must be packed into C or placed in V systems on a ground base, space base, or ship.   
    **6.32** Building from Space Bases.  Bases with shipyards (Sy) may produce other bases, ships, and small craft.  Each shipyard can produce 3 spaces of ships/bases/small craft per month.  Ships/bases with multiple shipyards on one base/ship **can not** combine to build larger ships in one month.  Such ships are built by a single shipyard over several months.  Multiple ships may be built, however, by one or more shipyards.  Each space of ship constructed costs one build point.  Some ships will be built over more than one month, but the type of systems on the ship must be determined the first month.  The cost of the ship may be paid for completely at the beginning, or may be paid for each month.  In order to build other ships/bases, the ship/base containing the shipyard must be in an area with a colonized habitable planet (containing EP), or carry the construction materials in cargo bays in the same area as the base/ship.  Each build point takes up one cargo space.  (Example:  The player has a 9 space base consisting of CCSySyE.  He decides to build a carrier and a destroyer.  The player pays 12 EP for the two ships.  At the end of the month, the DD is constructed from one shipyard, and the other shipyard has constructed 3 BP of the CV.  The next turn, the player constructs 3 more BP of the CV, even though the other shipyard is “idle.”  The third month, the player constructs the final 3 BP of the CV, and pays an additional 3 EP to build 6 small craft for the carrier.)   
	Bases may produce packed material to build bases, ships, and small craft.  The procedure for building packed ship material is the same for building a base ship or small craft, however multiple shipyards (Sy) may build parts for the same ship or base simultaneously.  Once completed the packed materials must be loaded onto cargo spaces on ships or bases in the same area.  The packed base/ship/small craft material must still be constructed into an operational base, ship, or craft.  
    **6.33** Building from Ships.  Ships with shipyards may construct bases, ships, or small craft, but must receive packed materials from cargo spaces in order to do so.  If a ship constructs anything, it must remain stationary in one area for the entire turn.  Each shipyard on a ship constructs 3 BP per turn, just like on space bases.      
  **6.4 How to Build**.  Here are the appropriate tables for building ships.

**6.41 Mines (Optional).**  A Space Base may build mines.  A “mine” is a small automated deep space buoy with an energy source and a single weapon.  A mine may consist of either a beam or missile weapon.  Mines are built “packed” that is they must be placed in cargo spaces and assembled on-site by a ship equipped with an Sy.  Each “mine” takes up one C space.  Mines may only be assembled in the same area as an inhabited area or base station (to control them).  When placed, the player must assign the mines a target to protect.  This may be an inhabited location or a base station.  In combat, the mines may only target ships or small craft which declare an attack against the target they are to protect.  The target may not be changed.  Maintenance for mines is equal to 1 MP for each mine.  Mines attack after all other forces in the combat phase.  Each mine is considered to attack separately, but all the mines protecting a single target do not have to shoot at the same enemy.  Note the presence of mines by adding them in front of the target they are to protect. (Example:  4 beam mines protecting a small base station would be annotated like this.  OOOO  SAO/\\CE).  Add the maintenance cost of the mines to the cost of the target.  An enemy does not have to attack all or any of the mines protecting a target (unlike when a ship protects another ship or base).  A player may not chose to destroy mines in place of systems on the base they are protecting.  Mines fire with no modifiers for crew skill.    

**6.5 Research (Optional).**  A player may spend economic points to research new technology.  An empire can spend at most 30 EP per turn on research.  Each point (EP) spent (up to the first 10 points) gives one 1 RP.  A player may only spend more than 10 EP on research of he has encountered another player (alien race) with a higher technology level, representing the empire attempting a crash program.  In this case, each two points (EP) spent after the first ten gives 1 RP gain (for a total of 20 RP, or 30 EP).  The total gain for the month is equal to the number of RP earned,, modified by \+/-d10.    Technology is developed once research equals the RP required.  An empire must develop the general tech level before developing any specific tech bonuses for that level.  Specific tech bonuses must be developed in sequence.  A player may not develop a later general tech level until he has developed at least one specific tech bonus at the current tech level.  All specific tech bonuses must be developed in sequence.  Groups are as follows:

| Tech Level | Cost | General | Economy | PCF | Beam | Missile | Shield | Armor | Close Defense | Small Craft | Engine |
| :---- | :---: | ----- | :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PRE | NA | PRE | No Growth | Hit on 0 | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA |
| IND | 100 RP | IND | Standard | \-2 to hit | \-2 hit | \-2 hit | NA | \-2 stop | NA | NA | Only BS |
| 0 | 100 PR | 0 | Standard | Std | \+0 | \+0 | \+0 | \+0 | \+0 | \+0 | \+0 |
| 1 | 100 RP | 1 | \+1 Max EP per area | \+1 to hit  | \-1 save | \-1 save | \+1 stop | \+1 stop | \+1 stop | \+1 hit | \+1 to initiative |
| 2 | 100 RP | 2 | \+2 Max EP per area | Per Dif | \+1 hit | \+1 hit | \-1 hit | \-1 hit |  | \-1 stop | Column shift in combat |
| 3 | 200 RP | 3 | \+3 Max EP per area | In tech | \-2 save | \-2 save | \+2 stop | \+2 stop | \+2 stop | \+2 hit | \+2 to initiative  |
| 4 | 200 RP | 4 | \+4 Max EP per area | Level | \+2 hit | \+2 hit | \-2 hit | \-2 hit |  | \-2 stop | 2 Column shift in combat |
| 5 | 300 RP | 5 | \+5 Max EP per area |  | \-3 save | \-3 save | \+3 stop | \+3 stop | \+3 stop | \+3 hit | 3 column shift in combat |

Example:  a player develops general tech level 2 after achieving general tech level 1 and Economy tech level 1\.  He may research any other specific tech level 1 bonus, or Economy tech level 2\.  He cannot develop Beam level 2 before developing Beam level 1, even though he is at General Tech Level 2\.  He cannot develop General Tech Level 2 before developing Economy Tech Level 2, or developing some other specific tech level to 2\.  

3. ##   **6.6 Trade.**  Players may conduct trade with other empires.  They can trade up to ¼ of the smaller player’s total EP (or less).  For each EP traded, the player receives 2 EP the following month.  The two players must trade the same amount.  The EP must be transported (1 EP \= 1 Trade Point \= 1 Cargo Point) to the other players star system to be unloaded at a base or inhabited planet.  A player must agree to at least an economic alliance in order to conduct trade.  Each player must also invest (i.e. spend) 10% of their total EP in developing markets for the trade products before trade can begin.  The percentage is based on total EP at the time of the trade agreement.

**7.00 WRITE ORDERS**  
  **7.1 Order Requirements**.  Players write orders for all of their empire’s activities.  In the absence of orders, the umpire/referee determines the actions of any particular force or empire.  
  **7.2 Types of orders**. There are many different types of orders.  Orders may be given to be executed immediately or upon certain conditions being met.  The most common order types are movement, unit/commander assignment, combat, production, colonization, and diplomatic orders.  Movement, combat, unit assignment, etc., functions can be combined into one order or many orders, but are separated for clarity of description in the rules below.  One’s imagination is the limit on orders, but remember the umpire/referee will generally be executing the actions given in the orders, so be clear.  
  **7.3 Movement Orders**.  Movement orders are given to TFs.  TFs must be given orders to move.  The orders should give the start and end points, route, actions at the destination, and any other special instructions.    
  **7.4 Unit/Commander Assignment Orders**.  Ships, commanders, equipment, etc., may be reassigned among different TFs that occupy the same area.  They may also be given a movement order and sent to an area to be assigned to a new TF.  
  **7.5 Combat Orders**.  Combat orders tell TFs and Bases how to fight.  These are normally standing orders, but combat orders can be given in specific occasions as well.  Combat orders may be general (“protect the carrier and transports”) or specific (all ES class ships attack the enemy’s largest ship).  
  **7.6 Production Orders**.  Each shipyard (Sy) or planet may be given orders for production.  The item to be built is paid for in the spend EP phase, and received at the end of the turn in which construction is completed.  (Optional:  Production orders are written in the write orders stage of the current month for items to be constructed beginning the following month.  This represents the planning needed to gather materials for construction).  
  **7.7 Colonization Orders**.  These orders are normally given in conjunction with movement orders for the transfer of EP from one location to another location.  
  **7.8 Diplomatic Orders**.  There are several states of relationship an empire may have with another empire once the two make contact.  

| State | Benefits |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **War** | Two empires may fight each other |  |
| **Non-aggression Pact** | Do not fight each other |  |
| **Economic alliance** | May conduct trade |  |
| **Military alliance** | May fight jointly |  |
| **Political alliance** | May trade and fight jointly |  |

A player may send orders to his embassies with other empires requesting a Non-aggression pact or an alliance.  If the other player agrees, the two empires are considered to have enacted the Pact or Alliance.  Players can renege on any alliances or pacts at any time, but note the requirements for the establishment of trade relations take time to implement.  

**8.00  MOVEMENT**

4. ##   **8.1 Fleets/Task Forces.**  All ships are considered to be part of task forces/fleets.  A FLT/TF may be composed of one or more ships.  All ships in the same FLT/TF are considered to be “together,” and may move, fight, supply, etc., together.  FLT/TF must be given orders to move.  The orders should give the start and end points, route, actions at the destination, and any other special instructions.  Ships in different FLT/TFs are not considered to be in the same location even though in the same area unless orders specifically state so.  Ships in an area are considered to be near a space base only if orders state so.  Opposing ships, bases, fleets may occupy the same area without combat, but only if both sides chose not to fight, or one side only contains ground/space bases.  

   5. ##   **8.2 Movement and Orders.**  Ships may only move when given orders.  Orders are sent from the capital to the location of the fleet/ships to move.  Orders travel at the speed of one week per system.  Orders sent to a fleet in the same system are considered to arrive “instantaneously.”

  **8.3 Areas**.  Star systems are composed of areas.  Areas are locations with significant features such as warp points, planets, and asteroids.  There is also a “survey” location for ships flying through the system on survey.  For game purposes, all locations are considered to be equidistant from each other except warp points.  It takes one week to travel from one area to another, except when flying directly from one warp point to another in which case it takes two weeks.    
  **8.4 Area Movement**.  Fleets move from area to area directly.  Fleets move from one system to another by using warp points.  A warp point allows a ship to travel very rapidly from one system to the warp point of the connecting star system.  It takes one week for the ships to transit along a warp point in galactic time (although the ships experience almost instantaneous travel).  When writing orders, a player should specify which system a fleet will remain in when moving to a warp point.  EX:  Player A orders TF1 to move from system 2 planet 2R to system 3 (TF1:  2 2R \-\> 2 WP03 \-\> 3 WP02).  The TF1 will move from the 2R location to the system 2 WP03 location and transit to the system 3 WP02 location.  The move will take two weeks.   
  **8.5 System Survey.**  It takes four months for a ship armed with survey equipment to survey a system.  Each additional ship reduces the required time by one week (to a minimum of 2 weeks).  The ships conducting the survey remain in the survey area for the entire duration of the tine necessary to complete the survey.  Otherwise any survey data is lost and the entire process must begin again.

**9.00 COMBAT**  
  **9.1 Conditions for Combat**.  Combat occurs when forces (planets, PCF, bases, or ships) of two or more players occupy the same area and **either side** wishes to fight.  The following matrix shows the allowed combat between various forces.

| Ship vs. Ship | either side may retreat |
| :---: | :---- |
| Ship vs. Base | Base may not retreat |
| Ship vs. Planet | Ship may only attack planet (EP) with missiles or Ground Base with missiles |
| Ship vs. PCF/planet | Ships/PCF may not attack each other |
| Small Craft vs. Ship | Small Craft must retreat with the ships that carry them |
| Small Craft vs. Base | Base may not retreat small craft as above |
| Small Craft vs. Planet | Bombers may attack ground base |
| Small craft vs. PCF/Planet | Assault Shuttles may attack PCF; vice versa |
| PCF vs. Planet | min. garrison=1; each PCF=1 EP (get up to ½ of tot.) |
| PCF vs. PCF/planet | may not retreat except on Assault Shuttles |

Generally, all forces of the same task force or fleet in an area fight together.  When several task forces/fleets move into an area to fight, the player may select one as the primary element.  That element may attack immediately; the others have to roll to join a battle.  Roll 1d6 for each additional fleet/task force at the end of each round:  on a 6 the fleet/task force appears for the next round.  
Since the battles will be fought by the GM, in order to influence how the battle is fought the players need to give fighting instructions for how the forces will fight, what ships to target, etc.  If not, the GM will play each side in a logical fashion.  
  **9.2 Combat Turn Sequence**  
	A) Space Combat Rounds  
	1\) Determine Initiative  
	2\) Announce Protective Measures

		7\) (Optional Resolve Mine Attacks)  
	8\) Determine Morale  
	9\) Conduct additional rounds as necessary   
	B) Resolve Planetary Combat

    **9.21** Determine initiative**.**  Each side rolls d10 and adds admiral/appropriate bonuses.  High score has initiative. Units with initiative shoot first for each phase, and fighting is **not** simultaneous.  
    **9.22** Announce Protective Measures.  Starting with the player without initiative, declare any protected targets.  Place protecting ships next to protected targets.    
    **9.23** Declare Small Craft Targets**.**  Starting with player without initiative, declare targets by small craft type.  
    **9.24** Resolve ship attacks.  Ships attack in order of speed.   A ship’s speed is the ratio of engine spaces to total spaces (ex:  3 space destroyer with 1 engine: speed is 1/3).  At each speed the player with initiative goes first.

**Ship Speed Columns**

| Size | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 12 | 1/ 12 |  | 2/ 12 |  | 3/ 12 | 4/ 12 | 5/ 12 |  | 6/ 12 |  | 8/ 12 | 9/ 12 |  | 10/ 12 |  | 11/ 12 | 12/ 12 |
| 9 |  | 1/9 |  | 2/9 |  | 3/9 |  | 4/9 |  | 5/9 | 6/9 |  | 7/9 |  | 8/9 |  | 9/9 |
| 6 |  |  | 1/6 |  |  | 2/6 |  |  | 3/6 |  | 4/6 |  |  | 5/6 |  |  | 6/6 |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  | 1/3 |  |  |  |  | 2/3 |  |  |  |  |  | 3/3 |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1/2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 2/2 |

Example:  Fleet A has three ships with speed 1/3, ¼, and ½.  Fleet B has two ships with speed ½ and 2/3.  Fleet A has initiative.  Order of firing is follows:

| Order | Fleet A | Fleet B |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 |  | Ship1 Speed 2/3 |
| 2 | Ship1 Speed ½ |  |
| 3 |  | Ship 2 Speed ½ |
| 4 | Ship2 Speed 1/3 |  |
| 5 | Ship3 Speed ¼ |  |

    **9.25** Resolve Base Attacks.  All bases now attack simultaneously (there should never be more than one side’s bases in an area).  
    **9.26** Resolve Small Craft Attacks.  Starting with the player who has initiative, resolve all small craft attacks for each type.  (Side A Fighters, Side B fighters, Side A bombers, etc.)  
    **9.26A** Optional Resolve Mine Attacks.  Mines attack after all other forces in the combat phase.  Each mine is considered to attack separately, but all the mines protecting a single target do not have to shoot at the same enemy.  Note the presence of mines by adding them in front of the target they are to protect. (Example:  4 beam mines protecting a small base station would be annotated like this.  OOOO  SAO/\\CE).  Add the maintenance cost of the mines to the cost of the target.  An enemy does not have to attack all or any of the mines protecting a target (unlike when a ship protects another ship or base).  A player may not choose to destroy mines in place of systems on the base they are protecting.  Mines fire with no modifiers for crew skill.  Mines do not retreat from morale loss.  
    **9.27** Determine Morale (Optional).  At the end of each round of combat, each side must roll a d10 and exceed the percentage losses (based on total number of ship spaces, rounded to the nearest 10%) in order to continue to fight.  A fleet that fails morale will attempt to withdraw.  A ship which may not withdraw (as well as bases or PCFs on planets) may surrender instead.  Roll a d10 and compare to the RO of the unit.  Add one (+1) per point the morale roll was failed by.  Subtract one (-1) for each point the enemy RO is higher than the unit’s RO (If enemy RO is lower add nothing).  If the modified die roll is greater than the unit’s RO, it surrenders.  
**Surrender Table**  

| Reason | Modifier |
| :---- | :---- |
| If in homeworld area | \-3 |
| If enemy has committed genocide of a race | \-3 |
| If enemy has destroyed population of an inhabited area | \-1 |
| For each point failed morale roll | \+1 |
| For each point enemy RO higher than own | \-1 |

    **9.28** Conduct Additional Rounds as Necessary.  If both sides still have space   
fleets/bases/etc. remaining, play continues with another round of battle.  If one side chooses to retreat, compare the speed ratios of all ships.  The retreating player must have faster ships than the other player in order to retreat, otherwise battle rounds continue.  Either player may choose to break up his fleet/task force in order to allow some ships to escape (or catch retreating ships.)  Once no space going ships of one side remain in the area, or neither side will attack the other, the battle ends.  Proceed to Planet battles if necessary.  
    **9.29** Resolve Planetary Combat.  Once all space combat is complete surviving space ships may launch an attack on any planetary bodies.  If there are ground bases defending the planet, conduct battle rounds between the space ships and the ground base.  If there are no ground bases (or they are destroyed), the ships may bombard the planet if they possess missile /\\ weapons and/or land PCFs via assault shuttles (As).  A player may choose to attempt to land PCFs while a ground base is operational, but the defending player may intercept any small craft with his own small craft as part of the combat.  If the player waits until after any ground bases and small craft are destroyed, all PCF may land automatically as long as the player possesses at least one As and a V space on the ships carrying PCF.    
      **9.291** Space to Ground Combat.  Space to Ground combat does not occur until all Space combat is completed.  Only ground bases and ships which specifically choose to attack the planet are included in the combat.  Conduct normal battle rounds between any attacking ships and small craft, and defending bases and small craft.  A player may chose to attempt to land PCFs during the Space to Ground Combat.  In this case, As spend one round loading one PCF on board, one round flying to the planet, one round landing the PCF on the ground, and one round returning to space.  The As may not be targeted while loading PCF, but may be attacked by small craft at any other time.        
      **9.292** Ground to Ground Combat.  Ground to Ground combat does not occur until all space or Space to Ground combat is completed.  Only PCFs or Assault Shuttles may participate in the Ground to Ground combat.  Each player rolls for initiative.  The player winning initiative attacks first.  Combat is not simultaneous.  In the first round of an opposed planetary landing, add \+1 to the planetary defender’s initiative roll.  The players, in initiative order, roll a die for each PCF involved in the combat.  The other player destroys one PCF for each hit (note the tech level difference is added to the higher tech player’s die rolls).  The other player then rolls a die for each of his PCF which survived.  As may attack each other or PCF in each round.  The planetary defender may call out the local militia to aid in the defense.  He receives one PCF for each EP in the planet.  These PCF are treated as Rw experience.  Each militia PCF destroyed temporarily decreases the EP of the planet by one (treat as if the decrease is due to colonization for regeneration rolls).  Continue Ground to Ground rounds until only one side possesses PCFs.  The attacker may retreat PCF on any As which survive.      

6. ##       **9.293**  Planetary Bombardment.  Some players may decide to destroy the EP of an inhabited location for whatever reason.  Destroying the EP of a location is more difficult than destroying a particular base.  For each /\\ system and each week that the ship remains in the area, reduce the EP of the area by one.  The permanent EP is not reduced, so the system chart will record the EP value of a planet that has been bombarded to 0 EP like this:  0/25.  Planetary bombardments may only occur after all other combat is complete.

   7. ##       **9.294**  Population Destruction.  The population of an inhabited area may only be destroyed by PCF landed on the area to round up and kill the inhabitants.  If a player chooses to do this, reduce the permanent EP of the area by one point for each PCF which remains in the inhabited area for one complete month.      

   8. ##   **9.3 How To Fight.**  In a battle round, a ship must fire all its weapons at one target.  Each beam or missile on a ship allows one attack die.  To hit the target ship, the roller must score a 6 or better.  After the attacking ship completes its attacks, the defending ship rolls a die for each shield or armor system he has.  To stop the attack, the roller must score a 6 or better.  Ships with no weapon systems may roll one d10 with a 0 to hit (representing the self defense beam weapons).  Ships with no defense systems may not roll to stop hits.  The defender may have more or less defending systems than the attacker has attacks.  When the defender has more systems, each system gets a roll, but can only stop up to the number of hits of that type (shield for beams, armor for missile).  If the defender has fewer systems, he only gets to roll the number of systems he has.  Extra successful attacks automatically do damage.  Each ship’s attacks are conducted independently of any other ship, so a defending ship may use its defensive systems against each attacking ship (assuming the systems are still operational) if it is attacked by more than one ship.  

    **9.4 Allocating Hits.**  Each hit the defender saves does not do damage.  Each hit that is not saved causes one system of damage.  The defender may choose what system to destroy.  This can include armor or shield systems whether or not the attack was caused by the “correct” type of attack.    
EX:  Cruiser 1 has two beam and one missile systems.  He rolls a d10 for each system, and hits with all 3 rolls.  Defending Dreadnought 2 has one shield and two armor systems.  The player rolls for the shield and successfully saves against one beam.  He rolls the two armor systems and succeeds twice, but since only one missile system hit, he only saves the one attack.  This leaves one hit for the defender to allocate.  He chooses to destroy an armor system.  Note all attacks from one ship are calculated simultaneously, and each ship must attack separately.  It is therefore possible for a ship to use its armor and shield systems several times, once per system for each different attacking ship.  
    **9.5 Small Craft.**  Attack after all ship combat is complete.  Ships may fire beam weapons during the ship combat phase at small craft.  A player must roll a 9 or 0 (10) to hit a small craft with a beam weapon.  Small craft have one space and are automatically destroyed if hit.  All small craft attack of each type belonging to a player attack simultaneously.  This means the player with initiative fires all his fighters, then the player without initiative fires all his surviving fighters, then player with initiative fires all his surviving bombers, etc.  Each small craft must attack the target it declared during the Declare Targets Phase.  If the target is already destroyed, the small craft does not attack.  Small craft roll one die each with a hit based on the target.

| Craft Type | Weapon Type | vs. Small Craft | Vs. Ships/Bases |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Fighter (Ft)** | Beam | 6+ | 9+ |
| **Bomber (B)** | Missile | 9+ | 6+ |
| **Recon ®** | Beam  | 9+ | 9+ |
| **Shuttle (Sh)** | Beam | 9+ | NA |
| **Aslt Shtl (As)** | Missile | 9+ | 9+/\*6+ ground targets |

Assault Shuttles are the only small craft which may attack ground targets.  
  **9.6 Tactics**.  Each player may employ special tactics as part of a battle.    
    **9.61** Protection.  A player may chose to protect one or more ships from attack.  To do so he announced the ship(s) to be protected and indicates the ships providing protection.  A protected ship may only be attacked if every protecting ship is attacked by enemy ships during the same round.   
    **9.62** Close Escort.  A player may choose to have a ship provide close escort to another ship.  The escorting ship may employ it’s D systems to protect against any enemy small craft that attack it or the escorted ship.  
    **9.63** Withdraw.  After a battle round, a player may withdraw some or all of his ships.  The player organizes his ships into groups that may remain or withdraw.  Withdrawing ships do not all have to withdraw together.  If the other player chooses to pursue, he reorganizes his ships into groups to pursue any/all of the enemy ships. Pursuing ships must be equal to or faster than the ships they are pursuing.  If so, continued battle rounds until the ships break off pursuit or become too slow to continue to engage.  
    **9.64** Extended Battle Example.    

**10.00 SYSTEM UPDATES**

9. ##   **10.1 Economic Growth and Recovery.**  

   10. ##     **10.11** Growth.  Only habitable planets can grow and gain economic points naturally.  All other areas can only increase EP through transfer.  Each habitable planet will grow up to 10% per year (unless the economy is stripped, see “Stripping an Economy” above).  At the start of each year, the max natural growth for the year will be one point per 10 EP or fraction thereof.  EX:  habitable planet with 15 EP will grow a max 2 points.  During the economic growth phase each month, each planet has a 10% chance per possible growth point of increasing its maximum EP.  EX:  the above planet has a 20% chance of gaining 1 EP.  Once the total number of possible EP have been gained, no further growth is allowed that year.  If the year ends without growth of all possible EP, increase the EP of the planet by enough EP (including the EP already gained) to equal the beginning number of EP divided by ten, rounding down.  EX:  If the planet above gained one EP during the year, it could not gain any more EP because 25/10=1.5 rounded to 1 \= the number of EP it already gained.  The habitable planet’s maximum EP may go up even if the actual revenue has been reduced due to colonization or militia PCF destruction. Growth and recovery occur independently of one another.

    **10.12** Recovery.  All planets (habitable or not) which have reduced revenue due to colonization (or militia PCF destruction) may recover production.  A planet has a 10% chance per EP below its current maximum of recovering one EP each turn.  A habitable planet has a 20% chance of recovering one EP each turn.  Example:  A G planet with 8/16 EP has an 80% chance of regaining 1 EP this turn.  If it succeeds, it will have a 70% chance of regaining 1 EP next turn.  An H planet with 20/24 EP has an 80% chance of regaining 1 EP next turn.  If it succeeds, it will have a 60% chance of regaining 1 EP next turn.  
  **10.2** Colonization.  When EP are transferred to a new planet, increase the receiving planet’s maximum EP (not potential EP) by the number of EP transferred.  The actual EP of the planet will remain at its current level.  On subsequent turns roll for EP “recovery” on the planet per the Recovery rules.  Example:  a player transfers 2 EP to the asteroid belt as part of his movement.  During the System Update phase, the player notes the asteroid belt now has 0/2 EP. On subsequent System Update phases, the player will roll to “recover” the EP on the asteroids as well as from the habitable planet where he transferred them from.    

11. ##   **10.3 Maintenance System Loss.**  For each required maintenance point not spent for a ship, the ship loses one system (player choice).

    12. ##   **10.4 Receive New Units/Repaired Units**.  Ships completing construction this month are commissioned at the location of the shipyard where they were built.  Ships in a shipyard to be repaired are repaired at the same rate ships are built.  Ships completing repair are released from the shipyard during this phase.

  **10.5 Receive Survey Information.**  Although survey information can be gained sooner, any remaining information is received in this phase if the survey is completed.  
  10.6 Experience Levels.

|  | Experience Level |  |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Type | Raw | Green | Average | Veteran | Crack | Elite |
| Crew | 1 speed Col shift \-2 to hit | \-1 to hit |  | \+1 to hit | \+2 to hit | 1 speed col. shift \+3 to hit |
| CPT/ADM | \-2 initiative | \-1 initiative | No change | \+1 initiative | \+2 initiative | \+3 initiative \+1 to hit |
| Requirement | 1st six months | until 1st combat | after 1st combat | 2nd combat after Av | 5th combat | 10th combat |

    **10.61** Allocating Experience.  Ships and CPT/ADM are allocated an experience level.  CPTs are not tracked separately until promoted to ADM (takes charge of a task force/fleet), or their experience becomes different from the ship.  This can happen if a player is independently tracking commanders and a crack ship suffers over 50% damage but the commander survives.  This is not important unless the captain becomes elite or the senior officer in charge of a task force/group/fleet.  
    **10.62** Experience and Ship Losses.  Ships which suffer greater than 50% damage in battle lose one experience level when repaired/replaced, representing the loss of too many personnel to train new recruits.  However, no ship loses experience below Green level once it has been in combat.  In other words, a Raw or Green ship which suffers over 50% damage will achieve Green experience after the battle.  
    **10.63** Experience Notation.  Crew and commander experience should be notated as follows.  Raw units note the experience level and the turn on which they were commissioned/repaired, ex:  Raw4.  Green units have no notation other than GRN.  Average and greater ships have their number of battles noted.  AVG1 represents a ship having participating in one battle after becoming average.  CRK7 represents a crack ship with 7 battles participated in.  (Optional:  Commanders who are promoted lose one experience level.  I.E. a Commodore (COM) promoted to Rear Admiral (RADM) loses experience from Crack to Veteran.)
