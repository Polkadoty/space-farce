# Space Farce Project Goals

## Core Game Architecture
The game will be built using a distributed client-server architecture:

1. Game Server (Go)
- Handles authentication and player sessions
- Manages game state and turn processing
- Provides deterministic galaxy generation seeds to clients
- Coordinates multiplayer interactions
- Validates player actions
- Processes combat resolution

2. Game Clients (Python + Pygame)
- Handles local galaxy generation using shared deterministic algorithms
- Renders game UI and handles player input
- Manages local game state
- Communicates with server for multiplayer actions
- Processes visualization and animations

3. Final Game Client (Rust + Vulkan)
- Replaces the Python prototype client
- Custom game engine built with Rust and Vulkan
- ASCII shader-based rendering for all game elements
- Optimized performance for large-scale battles
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Mobile platform support through platform-specific bindings
- Shared core logic with prototype client for compatibility

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Systems
- Implement deterministic galaxy generation (✓)
- Create basic visualization system (✓)
- Develop game state serialization

### Phase 2: Networking
- Build Go server with basic endpoints
- Implement client-server communication
- Add authentication system
- Create lobby system for multiplayer games

### Phase 3: Game Client
- Build Pygame-based UI
- Implement local game state management
- Add player controls and input handling
- Create combat visualization system

### Phase 4: Game Logic
- Implement turn processing
- Add combat resolution
- Create economic system
- Build research and development system

### Phase 5: Rust Client
- Develop Vulkan rendering pipeline
- Create ASCII shader system
- Port game logic from Python prototype
- Implement platform-specific optimizations
- Add mobile platform support

## Technical Requirements

1. All random elements must be deterministic and reproducible using seeds
2. Network protocol should be efficient and minimize data transfer
3. Client should be able to reconstruct game state from minimal server data
4. Server should validate all player actions
5. Combat resolution must be identical on all clients
6. Rust client must maintain compatibility with Go server
7. ASCII shader must support all game visual elements

## Testing Strategy
- Use Deterministic Simulation Testing for game logic
- Implement network simulation testing for client-server communication
- Create automated test suite for galaxy generation
- Build combat scenario test framework
- Develop Vulkan rendering tests
- Create cross-platform compatibility tests
