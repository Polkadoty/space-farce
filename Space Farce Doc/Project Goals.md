The goal is to create Space Farce as a digital multiplatform game available on the web, mobile, steam, and other platforms. I will build my own game engine using Rust and Vulkan, and use an ASCII shader to render the art, game, and UI.

For the moment, to prototype game logic, I will use Python because it is easier to write and debug. This will be used to test game logic in isolated environments.

The game will be testable using Deterministic Simulation Testing, which will be used to test for bugs and edge cases. All random elements will be deterministic and repeatable using a seed and pseudorandom number generator.
